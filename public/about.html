<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I am currently an employee for a small loans finance company that graduated with an associate degree in Information
   Technology many years back and would like to now get myself back to training in programming to finally make the change 
   in my career for myself and family.

<p>I love my dogs and am a huge dog lover. I would also say I am an all around animal lover in most cases. Still believe
  cats are very annoying creatures haha!
